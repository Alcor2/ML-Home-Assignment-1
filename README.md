# ML-Home-Assignment-1

The repository contains a report in .pdf format, Readme file and folders with jupyter notebook solution (jupyter notebook) and python script file (puthon file).

The python file (.py) code can be run in such IDEs as Spider or Visual Studio.

The jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) can be run in such IDEs as Jupyter and Colab.

It is strongly recommended to run the code in notebook format as it was initially designed via notebook-structured IDE. Therefore, the code run's results will be the most clear and readable in this type of IDE.

For the successful code run the following libraries should be installed (commands for installation are also provided for notebook format if the libraries are absent): \n
pandas - pip install pandas \n
numpy - pip install numpy
sklearn - pip install -U scikit-learn
datetime - pip install datetime
matplotlib - pip install matplotlib
scipy (mistakenly left in initialization, not used, can be removed) - pip install scipy
